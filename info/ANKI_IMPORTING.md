# About Anki Importing

In order to import your Anki flashcards to Oboete you have to export your anki flashcards with this settings.

The file once exported should be a TXT file that looks similar to this:

```
#separator:tab
#html:false
Front Content Sample	Back Content Sample
Cat Gato
Dog Perro
```
At least for now this is the only way to import Anki flash cards to Oboete. You can also check the custom import options for more advanced imports.
